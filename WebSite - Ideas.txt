CV (TODO)

Hello!
I'm Andrej Burovski, a passionate professional gameplay and tools engineer who loves to design and develop game-focused applications.
Got an interesting project? Send me a message at Andrej.Burovski@protonmail.com


BACKGROUND
I'm an independent gameplay and tools engineering contractor, currently based in Skopje, North Macedonia.
I work with a wide variety of clients, from individuals looking for someone to build their dream game to independent studios and startups that need a talented professional to help to develop their projects.
I graduated from Birmingham City University, with First-class Honours in BSc. 
Interactive Entertainment: Game Development, and have commercial AAA programming experience working as an Online Tools Designer at Rockstar North.

As an independent contractor, I take a lot of joy in being able to continually work on a variety of different projects as it forces me to interact with new technologies, work with new people and consistently allow me to keep growing and learning. 
There's nothing like the freedom of being able to always work on the most interesting up-and-coming opportunities that present themselves to you. My passion truly lies in game development. 
I love being able to design and develop interactive experiences that can be enjoyed globally by a wide-range of different audiences. 
I also love being able to create and experiment with the development of indie tools, as it gives me a chance to try and give back to the community I work in and hopefully make the lives of my fellow developers easier.
If I'm not working hard with clients, I'm probably working on a personal project, participating in a game jam, powerlifting or exploring the gorgeous highlands of my local area.
I'm always on the lookout for new clients with interesting projects to work on, so if you think that's you, send me an email!

Interviewer suggestions

I won't look at your code for fear of liability and because I don't have time. 
If you have a game, provide a precompiled Windows version and (more importantly) screenshots/video demonstrating features you're proud of. 
I will definitely look at screenshots.

For the most part, the only thing I care about your portfolio is how it shows the level of complexity you can handle.
Listing the technically challenging/innovative features that you implemented (influence maps? massive actor counts?) makes it relevant to me. 
Also gives interesting things to talk about in the interview (what scenario would kill perf of your influence map).

For new grads, the actually shipping decent-looking games is impreзџ
